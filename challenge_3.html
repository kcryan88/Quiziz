<h2>HISTORY OF THE SEA GAMES</h2>
<p>The origins of athletic competition lie in the mists of time when tribal members competed in the everyday skills of survival. The fastest and strongest were lauded, for it was they who ensured the tribeâ€™s continued existence, in times of peace and in times of war.

Certainly, <em>Laung Sukhumanaipradit</em> is hardly a household name, yet as a vice president of the <strong>Olympic Committee</strong>, he first floated the idea of a smaller sports event comprising the nations of the Southeast Asian peninsula, during the Third Asian Games held in Tokyo in 1958. At a meeting held on 22 May the same year, representatives from Burma (Myanmar), <em>Laos and Malaysia</em> met with their Thai hosts to explore the possibilities.

There was a certain logic to the idea. The countries of the region had many similarities. Modest of population and on a comparable economic footing, they shared common sports participation as well as roughly equal standards of achievement. Such an event would serve as a stepping stone for Southeast Asian athletes to raise their standards so as to be more competitive when they met more advantaged athletes in the larger arenas of the Asian and Olympic Games.</p>
